So I'll try to explain the data extraction side.Under the hood of whatever library you are using the code has to deal in HTTP requests and responses (the same kind of thing you use to access a website from your browser).For example to access the last data from a public channel put this URL into your browser (2102 is the channel number)http://api.thingspeak.com/channels/2102/feeds/last.jsonIf its not a public channel add your read API key like sohttp://api.thingspeak.com/channels/2102/feeds/last.json?api_key=YOUR_READ_KEY(logon to thingspeak and visit https://thingspeak.com/channels/CHANNEL_ID/api_keys to see your keys)To try these with hurl.it  choose the GET method and enter the URL's above.See the docs at https://au.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/get-a-channel-feed.html for more information and examples- to add more than one parameter separate them by & like sohttp://api.thingspeak.com/channels/2102/feeds.json?api_key=YOUR_READ_KEY&results=2This will allow you to see what your Huzzah is seeing- hopefully it helps figure out whats wrong.If you find the data is being updated properly let me know and I'll try to explain the updating side (slightly more complicated)", "num_user_post": " 271", "author": "rw950431"}, {"date": "January 15, 2016 - 8:55 am", "content": "Great! Thank you. Work looks to be rather busy today, but I'm hoping to swipe a few minutes on lunch to have a go at this. It'd would be great to find out if I'm just not updating or not pulling properly.", "num_user_post": " 7", "author": "TipsEZ"}, {"date": "January 15, 2016 - 1:54 pm", "content": "So I set my channel to public, and input the string for a public channel into hurl.it as a GET, below is what I got back:{'created_at': '2016-01-12T16:42:13Z','entry_id': 17,'field1': '#Thingspeak testing #FlagsHalfStaff','field2': null}So it looks like my recent change to post my Twitter string to Field one is functional. Next I input the following string to use as a GET after I sent a new Tweet.http://api.thingspeak.com/channels/78204/feeds/last.json?api_key=MYAPI KEYI received back in the body:{'created_at': '2016-01-15T18:50:41Z','entry_id': 18,'field1': 'Testing Thingspeak TweetControl for #FlagsHalfStaff','field2': null}So I'm guessing there is something I'm missing in the Thingspeak Arduino library. It looks like the data is indeed updating properly. Any further thoughts before I open up the Thingspeak header to try to figure out what parameters I may be missing?", "num_user_post": " 7", "author": "TipsEZ"}, {"date": "January 15, 2016 - 4:40 pm", "content": "I did some more reading and testing after I got some work stuff done, and I'm getting this to my serial monitor Error reading message.

Phew. Now to try to integrate all this into my code for my current project.I'd still appreciate learning anything else you have to offer.
