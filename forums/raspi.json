The data get's uploaded with the following code (slightly altered, as this is taken from a tutorial) to ThingSpeak:________________________________________________________________________________________________________________import thingspeakimport timeimport Adafruit_DHTchannel_id = 206897 # PUT CHANNEL ID HEREwrite_key  = '24GJQV17H7H4XGJ5' # PUT YOUR WRITE KEY HEREread_key   = '9EZ7E0918UVVAGAY' # PUT YOUR READ KEY HEREpin = 4sensor = Adafruit_DHT.DHT22def measure(channel):    try:        humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(sensor, pin)        # write        response = channel.update({'field1': temperature, 'field2': humidity})        # read        read = channel.get({})        print('Read:', read)    except:        print('connection failed')if __name__ == '__main__':    channel = thingspeak.Channel(id=channel_id, write_key=write_key, api_key=read_key)    while True:        measure(channel)        # free account has an api limit of 15sec        time.sleep(15)________________________________________________________________________________________________________________The transmission itself and displaying of the data works without any complications.Unfortunately, the router has some major issues and shuts down more or less every day. I will tackle that problem as well but for the moment I'd like to create a workaround. Hence the question: is it possible to locally log the data (in a round robin data base for instance) as soon as the wifi shuts down AND transmit all the logged data as a bulk to ThingSpeak as soon as the connection is up again?  This would help me to consistently monitor and analyze the necesseary information for the fermentation process online.If I just missed the right tutorial to do just that, a link might suffice to solve my problem. I'm eager to read and learn to solve my problems on my own but as of yet, I don't see a starting point.Thank you in advance.Cheers,Larimow", 'num_user_post': u' 1', 'author': u'larimow'}, {'date': u'August 30, 2018 - 10:28 am', 'content': u'I think I have the tutorial you ordered:https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/continuously-collect-data-and-bulk-update-a-thingspeak-channel-using-a-raspberry-pi-board.htmlPlease let us know how it works, and when there are open tastings!', 'num_user_post': u' 401', 'author': u'cstapels'}]}, {'url': u'https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/raspi/plot-two-data-into-the-same-graph-field-raspberry-pi/', 'posts': [{'date': u'August 19, 2018 - 5:06 am', 'content': u"I connected a sensor to capture (volt and current across a component) to a raspberry pi, and I wanna plot an IV curve.in my code, I'm running a sweep to capture those data, my code works just fine and I can plot the IV curve on my GUI by using matplotlib.In addition to my project, I wanna display/plot the IV curve online.

My current application is to put a heat sensor in a room and monitor that via Think Speak remotely. I am leaning toward using a Raspberry Pi for this because, as a standalone Linux environment, I can SSH into it easily from my remote location and make adjustments as necessary. This is import because the device will be monitoring temperature over seas.The reservation I have with this is that there are a lot more tutorials and documentation on using the Arduino and I wonder if the community has decided that the Raspberry Pi is not a good fit and that's why were  is not much adoption. The other reason just might be that HTTP post from Raspberry Pi is trivia whereas it requires a little bit not setup to get the Ethernet working on the Arduino.I realize the limitation of non-realtime IO on the Raspberry Pi but I want to make sure I'm not walking into any other traps. Does anyone know of any concerns?Thanks a bunch,-mike", 'num_user_post': u' 1', 'author': u'mmachenry'}]}, {'url': u'https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/raspi/eve-raspberry-pi-wireless-development/', 'posts': [{'date': u'November 26, 2012 - 12:29 pm', 'content': u'We\xa0have\xa0gotten a few reports of ThingSpeak running directly on a Raspberry Pi.
