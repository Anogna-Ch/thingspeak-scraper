You could just have the Arduino poll the thingspeak channel and change its servo power on state to match the state of the channel.You can use the talkback app to queue commands and then have the arduino poll for commands in the queue.  You can use MQTT to subscribe to the channel, and then the MQTT broker will push updates to your device when the channel value is changed.Here is a particle photon example for MQTT subscribe.https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/use-particle-photon-client-to-subscribe-to-channel-updates.htmlYou can do similar things on an arduino with the pubsub library.You can also just make a loop in your arduino code that polls the channel continuously to look for a change, like this cheerlights example:https://community.thingspeak.com/tutorials/arduino/cheerlights-with-arduino-and-the-fastled-library/Here is an example for reading from and writing to ThingSpeak with the Communication library.https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/rapid-prototyping-with-thingspeak.htmlIf you really need the arduino to write the state to your channel, then use the writing part of the examples (write with the REST API), or MQTT publish to put the state of the servo into your channel.', 'num_user_post': u' 401', 'author': u'cstapels'}]}, {'url': u'https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/thingspeak-plugins/customization-of-chart-with-multiple-series/', 'posts': [{'date': u'June 6, 2018 - 10:39 am', 'content': u"Dear Users,I have 5 individual charts who get data from a physical object I made using the 'Particle Photon Board'.

I still have no solution so would appreciate any helpIt seems that because I am using seriot I am forced to send individual sensor updates with each post rather than both at once. This means the JSON query being read by the google gauge readsPanel_Sensor,'10' Pool_Sensor,'null'then 15 seconds laterPanel_Sensor,'null' Pool_Sensor,'20'etc etcNow here is the interesting part. If the google gauge receives a null then it doesnt display the gauge. I have set the interval to 1 second for the gauge which means it constantly checks. As soon as a value becomes available, I then get a gauge displayed.So trying to code around this, I logically thought, okif (data.field1==null){p=0;}i.e if the JSON query returns null then trap that and change it to a null. However it seems that for some reason this implementation of the gauge code wont display a gauge if the value is zero. -1 is fine 1 is fine but you try sending it a zero and the need stays where it is. So for that reason, even if I trap data.field1 and turn it to a 0 the gauge still wont display on first load. similary if my temperatures fall to 0 its never going to show a gauge reading of 0.I suspect this is in some way because javascript is treating 0 in the same manner as null rather than just as another number. I am way out of my depth with javascript. I am sure its a simple change to the code to convert null to 0 and to have 0 treat as an actual number 0here is the snippet of code from the google gauge examplefunction loadData(){// variable for the data pointvar p;$.getJSON('https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/5384/feed/last.json?apikey=4DTOBCAIKO2WD3KB&callback=?', function(data){// get the data point       p = parseFloat(data.field2);if (p){displayData(p);}});}", 'num_user_post': u' 54', 'author': u'chrisjmears'}, {'date': u'January 9, 2015 - 8:02 pm', 'content': u"I know this is an old thread, but I'm experiencing the same thing as I'm updating 1 channel via 2 Arduino's - Null is posted for the fields the particular Arduino does not use, hence, the gauges then disappear.Any ideas?", 'num_user_post': u' 2', 'author': u'markswift'}]}, {'url': u'https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/thingspeak-plugins/dual-y-axis-for-multiple-fields-on-one-graph/', 'posts': [{'date': u'December 24, 2014 - 10:29 am', 'content': u'Can anyone advise on how to generate a second y-axis for one of the fields on a multiple-feed graph?Thanks', 'num_user_post': u' 9', 'author': u'geo3geo'}, {'date': u'December 29, 2014 - 9:23 am', 'content': u"Hi,To create a secondary y-axis, you'll need to modify the JavaScript and utilize Highcharts' API:http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#yAxis .

In order to better support our international users, we recently switched some of our database tables over to UTF8, and in the process some irregular characters may have caused the data immediately after them to be lost.  Do you remember if you had any non-alphanumeric characters (perhaps right after the 'Temp') in your code?
