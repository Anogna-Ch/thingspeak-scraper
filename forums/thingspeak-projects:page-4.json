The answer is we need an gateway application that serves to read sensor data using the Modbus protocol and then send them to ThingSpeak by using the API.For a real example of this application, I used to read real-time data from the sensors like Temperature, Pressure, and Flow Gas used for Bontang City Gas at Kalimantan Timur, Indonesia and then send it to ThingSpeak.
