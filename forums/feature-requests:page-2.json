However, each Channel's Feed has 8 'Fields' and several additional meta data fields (ex: status, latitude, longitude, ect...). An update to a Channel's Feed may only include data written to any of these specified fields. It is possible to work around this limitation by doing some creative data mapping.For example, you may write to a Channel's Feed in the following wayfield1: shelf_numberfield2: red_valuefield3: green_valuefield4: blue_valueA MATLAB Analysis app may be used to then read the data from the Channel using the MATLAB function 'thingSpeakRead' and perform some action. A React app may be used to trigger the MATLAB Analysis app to execute the MATLAB code on data insertion to the Channel. The drawback of this approach, where a shelf is a different data point, is that data can only be written to a Channel every 15 seconds. You can use custom 'shelf' values which may set selves 1, 2, and 3 all to the specified RGB values or others which set shelves 1 and 2 or any combination.There is a slight workaround for a 'batch upload' using the MATLAB Analysis app. Please see lee's post for more information: http://community.thingspeak.com/forum/thingspeak-api/rfe-minimum-for-feed-api/#p2372", "num_user_post": " 4", "author": "hans"}]}]}
