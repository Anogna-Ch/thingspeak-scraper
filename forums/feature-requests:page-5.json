I had some ideas and I worked on some of them, but my professor didn't accept them. Actually he doesn't have any ideas either because he's not familiar with IoT.I like to do my research on IoT with integration of some topics like health issues or Cities/Urabn issues. Unfortunately the thesis should contains implementation part too and I have to show some statistical reports and analyse data to prove results. They won't accept theoretical research, but it's acceptable if I use simulators in my thesis and I have to use some published papers as my references too. In another word it shouldn't be a completely innovate idea that nobody worked before. These are our faculty rules! I'm not a software developer and I just worked with C++ but I'll be able to learn simple programming if needed. I have about 5 months to complete my thesis and I would be appreciated if someone helps me find my master thesis topic. I should mention that it's better to choose a simple project at this step that I can finish and give results from it in this short time and then I will expand my research related to this topic in Ph.D.Thanks in advancedArmin", "num_user_post": " 1", "author": "armin"}]}, {"url": "https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/feature-requests/delete-bad-data-points/", "posts": [{"date": "July 8, 2011 - 7:23 pm", "content": "Scaling would help mitigate the problem with this, but when one of my data points is bad it throws off the scale of the chart. \u00a0I plan on putting some error correction in my script but the option would be nice.", "num_user_post": " 3", "author": "eisenhowerj"}, {"date": "July 12, 2011 - 1:58 pm", "content": "There are two API parameters that might help you filter bad data.You can filter using min and max parameters.
