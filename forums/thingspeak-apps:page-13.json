ThingHTTP is typically used by a low-level device looking to send a complex HTTP request and parse the response without doing that on the device.Here's what you can do with MATLAB Analysis:1) First, create a new ThingSpeak Channel2) Create a MATLAB Analysis (under Apps)3) Select the 'Scrape web temperature data' example4) Modify the MATLAB code with the ThingSpeak Channel info5) Set a TimeControl to call the MATLAB code every so often and this will update your channel with the data from the websitesIf you look over the example, you will see how it works. You can easily modify it to point to other sites and even get multiple pieces of data and write multiple values back to your channel at the same time.Let us know how it works for you...Hans", "num_user_post": " 402", "author": "Hans"}, {"date": "September 4, 2015 - 4:57 pm", "content": "Hi ebaugh, You could achieve this using the MATLAB Analysis app: https://thingspeak.com/apps/matlab_analyses. You would be using THINGSPEAKWRITE and URLFILTER function in MATLAB Analysis app. THINGSPEAKWRITE allows you to write data to a ThingSpeak Channel and URLFILTER allows you to scrape one or more number from a web page.
