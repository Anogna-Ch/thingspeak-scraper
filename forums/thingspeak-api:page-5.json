I want to create a MATLAB visualization that combines data from 2 fields of the channel, combine the data for a day and display it in the form of scatter or 2-d line plot. How can I do that? I am new to MATLAB and thingSpeak.\u00a0\u00a0I look forward to your answers.Thanks", "num_user_post": " 8", "author": "rushanarshad"}, {"date": "May 1, 2018 - 1:14 pm", "content": "Have a look at the code template tutorialshttps://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/getting-started-with-thingspeak.htmlAt the bottom there are examples for similar and different data types.
