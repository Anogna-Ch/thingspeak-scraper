Can anyone confirm this is the case as my MATLAB experience is very limited.\u00a0I am using this NON ELEGANT work around to refresh the public view, below. Edit your public channel ID and refresh time then save as an html file.

Use thingSpeakWrite() in your MATLAB analysis for example. \u00a0Then when you read that field,\u00a0If your data is numeric and you can display it in a plot, you can use the  to embed your plot in a page (raw html) \u00a0and set the plot to dynamic with a refresh rate where you want it.

The problem is both these iFrames DO NOT dynamically update when new channel values are received as the rest of the thingspeak iframes do, instead i have to manually refresh the whole screen using F5 keyboard key to view the new data.So my question is how do i assign a dynamic update to MATLAB visualizations?Thanks againRay", "num_user_post": " 11", "author": "rayellam"}, {"date": "September 14, 2017 - 3:28 pm", "content": "Ray,At present, it is not possible to have the visualizations update automatically in the same way thingSpeak plots update. \u00a0This may be considered as a possible upgrade in the future. \u00a0You may also consider using the plugins app. \u00a0Another possibility to consider would be to embed the <iframe> for your visualization in a different page that has an automatic refresh built in, but the rate available to you may be limited.\u00a0", "num_user_post": " 401", "author": "cstapels"}]}]}
