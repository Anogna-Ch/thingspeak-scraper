I've managed to start getting the values in there (https://thingspeak.com/apps/plugins/49459) but I need to figure out how to get a median for the temperatures like on the individual charts (https://thingspeak.com/channels/84330)According to what I read about getting the json data it should be enough to add the 'median=60' as in the example below but for some reason it doesn't work, any ideas?   // get the data with a webservice call    $.getJSON('https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/' + channel_id + '/fields/' + field_number + '.json?median=60&offset=0&round=2&results=' +    results + '&api_key=' + api_key, function(data) {", "num_user_post": " 1", "author": "Naesstrom"}, {"date": "February 24, 2016 - 4:20 pm", "content": "Hi, You are correct about the median parameter, adding that should give you the median for each series. I just verified that adding the median parameter to the getJSON call as you have shown did work. Here is a copy of my Javascript section:   // variables for the first series  var series_1_channel_id = 84330;  var series_1_field_number = 3;  var series_1_read_api_key = '';  var series_1_results = 100;  var series_1_color = '#d62020';  // variables for the second series  var series_2_channel_id = 84330;  var series_2_field_number = 4;  var series_2_read_api_key = '';  var series_2_results = 100;  var series_2_color = '#00aaff';  // chart title  var chart_title = 'Data3&4';  // y axis title  var y_axis_title = 'Values';  // user's timezone offset  var my_offset = new Date().getTimezoneOffset();  // chart variable  var my_chart;  // when the document is ready  $(document).on('ready', function() {    // add a blank chart    addChart();    // add the first series    addSeries(series_1_channel_id, series_1_field_number, series_1_read_api_key, series_1_results, series_1_color);    // add the second series    addSeries(series_2_channel_id, series_2_field_number, series_2_read_api_key, series_2_results, series_2_color);  });  // add the base chart  function addChart() {    // variable for the local date in milliseconds    var localDate;    // specify the chart options    var chartOptions = {      chart: {        renderTo: 'chart-container',        defaultSeriesType: 'line',        backgroundColor: '#ffffff',        events: { }      },      title: { text: chart_title },      plotOptions: {        series: {          marker: { radius: 3 },          animation: true,          step: false,          borderWidth: 0,          turboThreshold: 0        }      },      tooltip: {        // reformat the tooltips so that local times are displayed        formatter: function() {          var d = new Date(this.x + (my_offset*60000));          var n = (this.point.name === undefined) ?
