The same is true for sessions with a Keep Alive value of 0 (i.e. disabled).This is standard-conforming behavior, as the server is allowed to disconnect at any time, regardless of the Keep Alive. However, it is not really nice regarding low-power applications, as one of two things currently have to happen:A Keep Alive of less than 60 has to be chosen and the client device has to wake up and send a packet every 55 seconds (to be safe). OrFor every data packet with a period of greater than one minute, a new TCP connection and MQTT session have to be established.This is would normally not be necessary, as TCP connections are able to stay inactive yet connected ('established') for hours (days, really). In fact, TCP itself knows no idle timeouts at all but has the capability of sending keep-alive packets on its own.So, I would like to request considering to significantly raise the server-side timeout, or even better adhere to the Keep Alive requested by the client. If there are any concerns that led to implementing this extremely short timeout (e.g. fear of DOS attacks), I would love to hear about them.For the time being, I recommend to all users to set a Keep Alive value of 55 seconds or less in their clients. Quite a few implementations seem to use a default value of 60, which is nasty in this case, as it is just over the threshold and will unfortunately lead to a full reconnect every minute instead of just a ping.Anyway, thanks again for the MQTT implementation and maybe someone is able to sort this out.\u00a0Best regards,Kilian", "num_user_post": " 3", "author": "kilian"}, {"date": "December 7, 2016 - 4:15 pm", "content": "This being our initial release of the MQTT service, we had to make some trade-offs in our broker configuration. \u00a0This is because we don't have an infinite number of TCP sockets on the broker. \u00a0We want to give everyone a chance to try it out.
