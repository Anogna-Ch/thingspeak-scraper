There are 3 types of condition, one of them is Conectivity. With this type, you can program, for example if your are connected or disconnected to a specified wifi network (For example your home network), following this, Domote can check if you are in you home not. That's why Domote requiered wifi connection information.The microphone is necessary to use the voice asistant.
