The react will be fired the first time the value exceeds 100. Any continuous subsequent values posted to the field1 of channel 99999 that are above a 100 do not trigger the react. The first value that is below 100 will reset the react condition such that a subsequent value above 100 will trigger the react.If channel 99999's field1 was\xa00, 1, 2, 8, 9, 100, 101, 102, 103Then the react would be triggered once.If channel 99999's field1 was\xa00, 1, 2, 8, 9, 100, 101, 102,\xa099, 103Then the react would be triggered twice.The idea behind this is say you wanted to be notified when\xa0your\xa0smoke alarm went off. However, you do not want to be\xa0alerted continuously until you have reset the smoke alarm. When you did reset the smoke alarm, it started posting normal values to ThingSpeak.

TalkBack is perfect for battery-powered devices that need to sleep most of the time and wake up to see if there is anything to do and then go back to sleep, like a door lock for example. The lock is mostly going to be asleep to save battery power, but it can way up periodically and check TalkBack or be woken up by a button press to see if it should be opened or not.Devices powered by ThingSpeak and now with TalkBack will be able to both push sensor data to the ThingSpeak Cloud and check TalkBack if any commands are available all in one request.

Your Notepad suggestion worked for some fields but not for the Dew Point field. This\xa0made a dim light bulb go off in my brain! I think the reason why I am getting 'infinity' maths results is because temperature and dew point have different time stamps in the sql db. Naturally, Dew point has a different time stamp to the rest of the fields since it is a calculated param. By querying both variables for the latest entry in the same command, it only returns the value for one, not the other, hence the null value and the NaN/infinity maths result. What I need to do is query the variables separately and then do the maths ratio. Unfortunately when I tried it in Matlab, it didn't work either, but the gauge\xa0takes soooo long to load \xa0it is hard to work out what works and what doesn't.

It sounds like you want to do the following:1. Listen to twitter for a specific tweet to occur. The tweet will contain some unknown value and the known trigger.2. You want to be able to find the unknown value in the tweet and extract the unknown value3. Once the unknown value is extracted from the tweet, you want to write the unknown value to a specific Channel Field.If I understood the intention correctly, it is possible to do something similar in a slightly different way. TweetControl is currently limited to only triggering ThingHTTP requests when a tweet matches a trigger condition. TweetControl can 'pass' values to ThingHTTP via 'substitution keys' in a ThingHTTP request.Currently, TweetControl nor ThingHTTP cannot parse or alter the substitution values. Given the example scenario above, it is currently not possible, for TweetControl to modify the substitution values prior to passing the values to ThingHTTP. Likewise, it is not currently possible for ThingHTTP to alter or modify substitution values once the have been provided to ThingHTTP. This does not mean it is not possible to accomplish the same end objective within the given framework. It is possible to create a TweetControl to listen for a specific trigger value. The entire tweet may be 'written' to a Channel using ThingHTTP. Once the full tweet is in a Channel, a React app may trigger a MATLAB Analysis app to execute whenever data is inserted to this 'intermediate' Channel.

For example, what convention are you using to differentiate data points from various sensors in a single Channel? MATLAB provides a function 'subplot' to create multiple axes in a figure. The 'subplot' function works with static MATLAB plots and does not work with dynamic plotting functions (thingSpeakPlot ect..). More information on the 'subplot' function is available on the following Documentation center page:http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/subplot.html?searchHighlight=subplotIt is also possible to plot multiple series in a single MATLAB plot.

I've got that sorted.My problem is how to make one visualisation app reusable based on the SensorID as an input?This same concept could be used for any kind of data.Example - IoT temperature sensors:I plan to build a large number of temperature data logging devices (using 1-wire temperature sensor and an ESP8266 wifi module.Each temperature sensor has an 64bit ID.Proposed ThingSpeak solution:Code all the micro-controllers identically with the same thingspeak write key.Store the data for all sensors in a single channel.Fields: datetime, SensorID, temperatureCreate a single visualisation  that has the SensorID as an input.Embed on a web page multiple lines like this:[iframe src='https://thingspeak.com/apps/matlab_visualizations/27986?SesnorID=A5D4c4EE62' width='100%' height='220'][iframe src='https://thingspeak.com/apps/matlab_visualizations/27986?SesnorID=EE62A5D4c4' width='100%' height='220']etc.End result you have a data storage and visualisation system for any number of temperature sensors without requiring the micro controller to have customised writekeys. You only need to configure one thingspeak channel and one visualisation app.All the above solution is missing is the ability to provide an input to visualisation apps via the URL.I hope I have explained myself well enough for other to see the power of a feature like this.Cheers,Matthew.Cheers,Matthew Driver", 'num_user_post': u' 6', 'author': u'Matthew Driver'}, {'date': u'October 14, 2015 - 12:10 am', 'content': u"Matthew/    I wonder if the URL query string is available in the thingspeak  MATLAB via getenv() ?

As i say kind of a mailbox over http which is lovely because it avoids all the headaches of setting up port forwarding on a users lan. it just works out of the box.So currently it does the followingSend to thingspeak -->Grab latest commands which are waiting <--In future I plan to add a feature to the app to allowed timed control of the backup electric heater.So the app will then have a page which allows the user to set times for the heater to be on and off. This will then add a new timecontrol command when the user selects send.When the thingspeak time control server arrives at the correct time I want it to issue a new talkback command for heater on/off which will be picked up the next time the solar controller updates the channel.Hopefully thats clear.
