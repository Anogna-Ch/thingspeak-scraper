I made tests with my Aruino Y\u00fan and it seemed to work good (data was being uploaded to Thingspeak), so I decided to install it yesterday.For some reason, the code has not updated values until today, when I\u00b4ve gone with my computer and I\u00b4ve opened the Serial monitor. In that moment... has started working!  And when I\u00b4ve left, problems again...What could happen?
