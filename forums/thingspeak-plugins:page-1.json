You could just have the Arduino poll the thingspeak channel and change its servo power on state to match the state of the channel.You can use the talkback app to queue commands and then have the arduino poll for commands in the queue.  You can use MQTT to subscribe to the channel, and then the MQTT broker will push updates to your device when the channel value is changed.Here is a particle photon example for MQTT subscribe.https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/use-particle-photon-client-to-subscribe-to-channel-updates.htmlYou can do similar things on an arduino with the pubsub library.You can also just make a loop in your arduino code that polls the channel continuously to look for a change, like this cheerlights example:https://community.thingspeak.com/tutorials/arduino/cheerlights-with-arduino-and-the-fastled-library/Here is an example for reading from and writing to ThingSpeak with the Communication library.https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/rapid-prototyping-with-thingspeak.htmlIf you really need the arduino to write the state to your channel, then use the writing part of the examples (write with the REST API), or MQTT publish to put the state of the servo into your channel.", "num_user_post": " 401", "author": "cstapels"}]}, {"url": "https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/thingspeak-plugins/customization-of-chart-with-multiple-series/", "posts": [{"date": "June 6, 2018 - 10:39 am", "content": "Dear Users,I have 5 individual charts who get data from a physical object I made using the 'Particle Photon Board'.
