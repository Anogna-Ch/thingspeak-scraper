The arduino basic example seems to work well when using one analoge input to update a graph.\u00a0I tried adding the updateTwitterStatus function into the mix (yes I've defined the thingsTweet api variable) and it consistently gives me a 400 bad request. I'm not even calling the function yet from the loop. Simply having the function in my sketch causes the 400 bad request. The sketch compiles fine with no errors. Here's the function:\u00a0void updateTwitterStatus(String msg){\u00a0\u00a0if (client.connect() && msg.length() > 0)\u00a0\u00a0{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0// Create HTTP POST Data\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0msg = 'api_key='+thingtweetAPIKey+'&status='+msg;\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Serial.println('Connected to ThingTweet...');\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Serial.println();\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0client.print('POST /apps/thingtweet/1/statuses/update HTTP/1.1n');\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0client.print('Host: api.thingspeak.comn');client.print('Connection: closen');client.print('Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedn');\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0client.print('Content-Length: ');\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0client.print(msg.length());\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0client.print('nn');\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0client.print(msg);\u00a0\u00a0}\u00a0\u00a0else\u00a0\u00a0{\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Serial.println('Connection Failed.'); \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Serial.println();\u00a0\u00a0}}\u00a0While trying to debug this problem I removed the client.print commands from this function but left everything else in and then the sketch started working properly. If I left even just one line of client.print in the\u00a0updateTwitterStatus function the sketch fails. I also tried creating a new instance of client called clientTwitter leaving client for the \u00a0updateThingSpeak function. Still caused problems.\u00a0I'm kind of stumped here. Is this an arduino ethernet library bug or is it a thingspeak problem?", "num_user_post": " 2", "author": "nickv"}, {"date": "July 22, 2011 - 6:19 pm", "content": "This does not solve the imediat issue, but you can post and Tweet at the same time if you want.example: field1=6&twitter=(twitter username linked with ThingTweet)&tweet=(your tweet)You would only want to do this\u00a0occasionally\u00a0and not with every insert to your ThingSpeak channel.
