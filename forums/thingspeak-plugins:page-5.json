I still have no solution so would appreciate any helpIt seems that because I am using seriot I am forced to send individual sensor updates with each post rather than both at once. This means the JSON query being read by the google gauge readsPanel_Sensor,'10' Pool_Sensor,'null'then 15 seconds laterPanel_Sensor,'null' Pool_Sensor,'20'etc etcNow here is the interesting part. If the google gauge receives a null then it doesnt display the gauge. I have set the interval to 1 second for the gauge which means it constantly checks. As soon as a value becomes available, I then get a gauge displayed.So trying to code around this, I logically thought, okif (data.field1==null){p=0;}i.e if the JSON query returns null then trap that and change it to a null. However it seems that for some reason this implementation of the gauge code wont display a gauge if the value is zero. -1 is fine 1 is fine but you try sending it a zero and the need stays where it is. So for that reason, even if I trap data.field1 and turn it to a 0 the gauge still wont display on first load. similary if my temperatures fall to 0 its never going to show a gauge reading of 0.I suspect this is in some way because javascript is treating 0 in the same manner as null rather than just as another number. I am way out of my depth with javascript. I am sure its a simple change to the code to convert null to 0 and to have 0 treat as an actual number 0here is the snippet of code from the google gauge examplefunction loadData(){// variable for the data pointvar p;$.getJSON('https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/5384/feed/last.json?apikey=4DTOBCAIKO2WD3KB&callback=?', function(data){// get the data point       p = parseFloat(data.field2);if (p){displayData(p);}});}", "num_user_post": " 54", "author": "chrisjmears"}, {"date": "January 9, 2015 - 8:02 pm", "content": "I know this is an old thread, but I'm experiencing the same thing as I'm updating 1 channel via 2 Arduino's - Null is posted for the fields the particular Arduino does not use, hence, the gauges then disappear.Any ideas?", "num_user_post": " 2", "author": "markswift"}]}, {"url": "https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/thingspeak-plugins/dual-y-axis-for-multiple-fields-on-one-graph/", "posts": [{"date": "December 24, 2014 - 10:29 am", "content": "Can anyone advise on how to generate a second y-axis for one of the fields on a multiple-feed graph?Thanks", "num_user_post": " 9", "author": "geo3geo"}, {"date": "December 29, 2014 - 9:23 am", "content": "Hi,To create a secondary y-axis, you'll need to modify the JavaScript and utilize Highcharts' API:http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#yAxis .
