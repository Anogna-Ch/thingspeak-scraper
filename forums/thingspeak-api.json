I have done about 4000 tests sending parameters to Thingspeak platform like temperature, humidity, etc.. Once I have finished my code, I think my code is very stable, but I have noticed that around a 2% of the requests, aren't plotted in the charts. In order to resolve this problem, I have developed a very simple data logger to log every response code returned by the ThingSpeak server.According to the results logged, I can see that the server sometimes returns a '202' code, a '0' code, and sometimes returns '1' code. In all these cases, the request has been stored in the database and plotted in the corresponding chart. The problem is that sometimes the code returned by the server is a '0 code', or '505 code', and the request is lost, and is not showed in my channel.I don't understand what is the meaning of some codes. For example, every time I received the code 202 or 1, the request is successful stored, but when I receive a '0 code', sometimes (very few times) the request is not stored. At the moment I'm working with only with four devices, but in the future I will work with 22 devices, so this error rate can increase, so this can supose a very serious problem for me.This is the part of code where I send data to the server and receive the corresponding code:/*** //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////* bulkUpdate* //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////**/void bulkUpdate(int indexIni, int IndexFin) {int ldata = getlengthData(indexIni, IndexFin);String potencial = '';client.stop();if (client.connect(server, port)) {Serial.println('[-] Enviando datos !!!!

This helps us formulate better code for error tracking.  I suggest you increase the content you are looking for in the error code.  See the last function about getting the full response in this example (I think its section g)https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/MoistureMonitor.htmlWhen you parse the response for just a number, you are losing a lot of information.  If you successfully connect to the bulk update API, it will return a json formatted response.  When you parse and get a zero, that might mean it did not find a number at all in the response.  When it gives a 1, that is probably not the HTTP response.  The regular write endpoint can respond with a 1, but not bulk.I suspect you are having a connection failure or buffer overflow for those few posts.  Make sure your time stamps have integer values of seconds just in case.I just managed to see 43 successful posts in a row, at 1  minute each.  If I use your 2%, the probability of that is still about 42%, so ill keep logging and see, just in case.If you catch the full response when you get a 0 or 1, can you share what you saw?505 is definitely a bad format, but still could be a buffer issue.', 'num_user_post': u' 401', 'author': u'cstapels'}, {'date': u'June 23, 2018 - 5:26 am', 'content': u"Hi cstapels!  You always respond to me very quickly \U0001f642 thanks.As you said in the previous message, I guess that the '0 codes' and '1 codes' may mean that some information is lost in the process. The bulk update feature uses a json format, so the Content-type must be 'application/json'. For this reason, my code use exactly the same mechanism explained in the tutorial 'Bulk-Update a ThingSpeak Channel Using an Arduino MKR1000 Board or an ESP8266 Board'.The part or code is this:###############################  ........................  delay(250); //Wait to receive the response  client.parseFloat();  String resp = String(client.parseInt());  Serial.println('Response code:'+resp); // Print the response code. 202 indicates that the server has accepted the response............................###############################I think this is not the best way to manage the response, because the format response is not a simple code, in fact is in json format.

I mean, if you have like 2 102 400 entries in your channel corresponding at sensors updating each 15sec for a year, and you want to grab this year of data with a timescale of  1440, this should gives 1460 entries. Far better than grabing the 2102400 just for generating a year graph.But you can't because it will filter the last limited entries (looks to be 8000 )  giving only 5 result ( 8000/1440)There's no sense of having a timescale parameter capable of 1440 if the source data is filtered before to the last 8000 entries.It should work the other way, first it filters data with timescale from your database, then if there's more than the limit, only deliver the last 8000..This looks more a bug than a feature, or have I missed something ?

Therefore, even when the feed parameter for setting timezone is specified,  the high-chart will always default back to using the browser timezone. Note that, changing the OS clock's timezone should lead to thingspeak high-chart display to change the timezone used for x-axis. But, changing your account setting will not affect it.To enable charts to be displayed with fixed timezones, create a MATLAB Visualization App, read data from your channel, change the timezone and create a plot. For example:[data, time] = thingSpeakRead(52499, 'Fields', 1, 'NumPoints', 100);time.TimeZone = 'Asia/Kolkata';plot(time, data);xlabel('Time in Kolkata timezone');title('Data displayed with Shifted timezone');You can then embed the MATLAB plot into other webpages.For more information on the datetime function, following this link:http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/datetime.html- Adarsh", 'num_user_post': u' 62', 'author': u'Adarsh_Murthy'}, {'date': u'September 15, 2015 - 3:35 pm', 'content': u"Thanks Adarsh. I had a feeling I would have to use MatLab to do this and you have verified my thoughts. Does that mean that the timezone parameter (in ThingSpeak charts) is basically useless?

This kind of thing can be massively confusing, and also largely inconvenient for the new user.It would be nice for ThingSpeak to have a data DOWNLOAD option that has a time-zone drop-down menu that allows users to download the data file matched to the user's local time-zone.But there appear to be no such feature at the moment.So, at the moment, the date-time column will be in some kind of standard time form---- ie. 'UTC' time, and the downloaded time values will be referenced to '0'. Yes.... 'zero'.So what you need to do is to use Google. And if you happen to live in say Tokyo, then google 'Tokyo UTC'. The google result will say something like 'GMT+9' for Tokyo. Note the 'plus 9'. This means you need to add 9 hours to the time values that you see in your downloaded ThingSpeak file.ThingSpeak typically gives you a 'CSV' file. So what you need to do is to open this CSV file using microsoft EXCEL. And then you need to SAVE that excel file to some other format, such as .xlsx format. This let's you take advantage of being able to use excel formulas to convert ThingSpeak date-time information to something that Excel can really use.Eg. you might see this in cell A2:\xa0\xa0\xa0 2017-12-17 13:30:01 UTCIf you have a blank column, such as column M, then in cell M2, you enter a formula (into cell M2), such as: \xa0 = LEFT(A2, LEN(A2) - 4)Cell M2 will then contain: 2017-12-17 13:30:01Then, in cell N2, type this formula:\xa0\xa0 =M2 + 9/24The important value is the '9' in the above line. The '9' makes excel add the 9 hours to get a time code linked to Tokyo's local time.Then, in cell O2, type the same formula manually into cell O2:\xa0\xa0 =M2 + 9/24Also, do the same for cell P2. Type the same formula manually into cell P2:\xa0\xa0 =M2 + 9/24Here, the values in column M, N, and O will all be the same. This is where you can play around with the column formatting.For example, if you highlight column N, and then choose to format the cells in column N to a 'Time' format. And if you also choose the 'Type' of time to be twelve-hour format (ie. AM/PM), then column N will be converted by excel time-formatting to 12 hour AM/PM format.And, for column O, you could format the column to be 'Time', and choose the 'Type' to be 13:22:00 format, which is 24-hour format.Both columns N and column O will be in Tokyo local time, which is 9 hours ahead of the ZERO UMT (or GMT) reference time.", 'num_user_post': u' 4', 'author': u'SouthPark'}, {'date': u'December 29, 2017 - 2:40 pm', 'content': u'There is an API you can use to retrieve all the data in a channel:https://api.thingspeak.com/stream/channels/CHANNEL_ID/feeds?api_key=READ_API_KEY&timezone=TIMEZONEList of valid timezone entries is here.

It will certainly confuse them.I'm thinking that the ThingSpeak admin should fix up the system, or at least put some kind of pop-up note to just let users know where to download the 'full data set', rather than make new users wonder why they just receive a small portion of the full data set.Or at least have a sticky or notification in the Private View and Public View pages that says something like 'For web-browsers, don't use this area to download data sets.......instead, use the Data Import / Export option (next to the 'API Keys' button) for downloading full data set'.

But all of the solder joints seem just fine, and the whole thing is 'clean' insofar as there is no dust, nothing is shorting against anything else, etc.http://i.imgur.com/yPMED4p.jpgSo here's the thing- I still have my breadboard circuit, and I have a total of 6 NodeMCU's (one purchased as a single, the other in a 5-pack). So I can swap NodeMCU's into and out of the breadboard. The program that I have prints to the serial terminal continuously, and sends data to ThingSpeak once every 20 seconds.\xa0The code & the breadboard circuit work fine with two different NodeMCU's. I get data both in my serial terminal & on ThingSpeak.Here's the thing-- I'll put the code onto the NodeMCU built into my device, and everything works except sending data to ThingSpeak. The serial terminal works fine; the sensors are all reading normally. But not a single data point will show up online.

Something using a Shinyei PPD42 and then exploring what sort of data it collects.https://www.thingspeak.com/channels/6855#The EI IMP001 is a low cost  device on an SD card format that has 6 pins one end and WiFi the other end. Its not open source, but is being developed as industrial strength and scale-able. It has programs developed on an EI cloud interface in 'Squirrel'  (like python) to be loaded into the device (IMP001) and agent. The device has the WiFi/internet stack, assumes a WiFi local agent and is setup with a smartphone app. Once the device is active it communicates with the agent in the cloud.  Once connected, the device can be used to manage the hardware interface and the agent is used to interface to the internet - say ThingSpeak.So the agent(internet) side that writes to a ThingSpeak channel is// ThingSpeak account credentialsconst TsApiWriteKey = 'xxxxyyy'const TsChannelId = 'cccc' //Not needed for a write// Class for reading/writing a feed at thingspeak.comclass TsFeed {  static url = 'http://api.thingspeak.com/update'  wrApiKey = null  feedID = null  constructor(wrApiKey, feedID) {    this.wrApiKey = wrApiKey    this.feedID = feedID  }  // Send data to feed, expects a table with channel:value pairs  function push(data, callback) {//TsFeed    local datastreamTs = []     foreach(channel, value in data) {      //server.log('TsPush: '+channel+'='+value)      datastreamTs +=  '&'+channel + '=' + value    }    local postHeaders = {        'Host': 'api.thingspeak.com',        'Connection': 'close',        'X-THINGSPEAKAPIKEY': wrApiKey,        'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' }    //server.log(format('%s',datastreamTs))    http.post(url , postHeaders, datastreamTs).sendasync(callback)  }}//end TsFeed//Handles the response from the asyn Post to serverfunction onUpdateTs(res) {    if (200 != res.statuscode) server.log('AgtResultTsFail: ' + res.statuscode )}// Handler for updates from devicedevice.on('putPsTs', function(data) {  //server.log('AgtPutTs: ' + http.jsonencode(data))  feedTs.push(data, onUpdateTs)})// Create feed objectfeedTs <- TsFeed(TsApiWriteKey, TsChannelId)//EOF --------------------------------------------------On the  device side the code to create an event 'putPsTs' to push it to the agent  is -   agent.send('putPsTs',{       'field5': concentration      ,'field4': pulselong      ,'field3': pulseshort      ,'field2': particle1min_cnt      ,'field1': ratioMin_per    });---------------------------------------", 'num_user_post': u' 3', 'author': u'neilh'}, {'date': u'January 12, 2017 - 11:54 am', 'content': u"It's a little late, but I want to thank you for this post.\xa0 It really helped me out today.\xa0Thanks again!G", 'num_user_post': u' 4', 'author': u'glynnbebee'}]}, {'url': u'https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/thingspeak-api/multiple-temps-in-one-message-help-please/', 'posts': [{'date': u'January 4, 2017 - 12:45 pm', 'content': u"Wondering if anyone has a minute and can tell me how to modify this code to send multiple temperatures to Thingspeak?I have working the Electric Imp code to send 1 temperature, but have not been able to modify it to send 6 temperatures.\xa0 The temperatures are stored in an array.\xa0 I'm getting datapoint.temp[1] through to Thingspeak, but don't know how I would also send in the same message datapoint.temp[0], datapoint.temp[2], datapoint.temp[3] and datapoint.temp[5].\xa0The Device Code I have now is:local datapoint = { \xa0\xa0\xa0 'id' : id, \xa0\xa0\xa0 'temp' : [ format('%.2f',myThermistor0.read_f()), \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 format('%.2f',myThermistor1.read_f()), \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 format('%.2f',myThermistor2.read_f()), \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 format('%.2f',myThermistor3.read_f()), \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 format('%.2f',myThermistor4.read_f()), \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 format('%.2f',myThermistor5.read_f()),] }agent.send('thing1', datapoint.temp[1]);\xa0The Agent Code (online Web-IDE) I have now is:local thingSpeakUrl = 'http://api.thingspeak.com/update';

To take an example, lets say you had 2 entries posted via the API at 11:00 AM and 12:00 AM to a freshly cleared channel, these two would be entry (1) and entry (2) which have a date of today. Now, you imported your data from a CSV that had 200 rows. The entries # 3-#202 in the database would actually\xa0have been measured\xa0before entry (1) and (2).

To take an example, lets say you had 2 entries posted via the API at 11:00 AM and 12:00 AM to a freshly cleared channel, these two would be entry (1) and entry (2) which have a date of today. Now, you imported your data from a CSV that had 200 rows. The entries # 3-#202 in the database would actually\xa0have been measured\xa0before entry (1) and (2).

I have a lot of things to try to explain / ask, so we can get to the bottom of the issue. We might need a few exchanges in order to get to the heart of the issue.1) Looking into your channel data, I see that Field 8 gets a lot of 'nulls' - and only every once in awhile I see actual values like '3.67'.You can see it with this API call: https://thingspeak.com/channels/71167/fields/8.json?days=5&timezone=America/New_YorkAre you updating your channel with separate requests? For example: /update?field1=100 and then another request like /update?field2=200 ? If you do the updates to a channel with separate requests, then the other fields get a null value. You should send requests that look like /update?field1=100&field2=200 (send multiple fields in one request). You might be sending all of the data at once, so you might want to look at what is causing the nulls in your channel.2) Nulls\xa0skew average calculations. You are getting very low averages since you are averaging null, null, null, 3.67, null, etc. The average is going to be really low.3) A median might be better suited for your data. Try this:https://thingspeak.com/channels/71167/charts/8?days=100&median=daily4) I would also like to suggest MATLAB Analysis - if you are not able to send cleaned up data to ThingSpeak, then you can use MATLAB Analysis to read in the raw data, process it, then write the processed data to a new channel. Then, you do not have to use the average / median filters that the API provides. average / median only solves some basic clean up use cases. MATLAB ANalysis is intended to be complete custom clean up and processing of IoT data.Let us know if this helps.Hans", 'num_user_post': u' 402', 'author': u'Hans'}, {'date': u'June 24, 2016 - 5:39 am', 'content': u">1) Looking into your channel data, I see that Field 8 gets a lot of 'nulls' - >and only every once in awhile I see actual values like '3.67'.yes sir correct, however, I am not the one who make the nulls \U0001f642>Are you updating your channel with separate requests?YES, correct again \U0001f642 so I am the one who make the null, simply due to another problem, I use several wireless sensors, they send data at different rates, but to the SAME database, just different curve, and to make it even worse, I send my battery voltages at a very low rate, simply due to the 8000 point limit, this way I tried to make the time span wider for voltage curves.>2) Nulls\xa0skew average calculations.

I have two channelsand for now I am posting only randoms numbers between 0 - 500. After around 4 hours of continuous update to channel,the communication with the Thingspeak stalls. I do not see new values being updated on my channel. I ran the testfor twice or thrice and found this value of 4hrs. I have also checked whether the communication between SIM900 and Arduino stops, but it is not so.I have wrote a simple program (within the above program) to send me a SMS if i give a miss call to the GSM module.So this works even after updating stalls.Does Thingspeak has any such limitation??

That was sort of my clue as it tended to stop even earlier with all the debug enabled.In my cases it simply stopped sending out any data but was still trying to connect and I combed my program looking for some simple error.It took me a while but I traced it down to delay statements and serial print statements causing a timing issue.Still not 100% sure just what it was as I did a blanket remark '//' on almost all the print statements apart from one that reads thingspeak responses 1 character at a timeI also reduced some of the delay statements or even remarked them out too where they were not actually required. The millis statements are not always as accurate as I would expect and to that aim I have some RTC's on order to add in to my setups.One of my channels ( 60110) has run pretty much perfect since then and any data anomalies I see are almost always ones I caused by testing with such as lighters on my temprature probes and lighter gas on my gas sensor etc.Just  brought another channel online  (62674) that is also pretty stable. as I learned a lot of lessons. I even have my reconnect time down to about 8 seconds because it always takes more than the 15/16 seconds they recommend just for my stuff to get the readings before it posts them.Maybe post your code to see if anyone can spot something obvious.Hopefully you are better than me at keeping you live code separate from the rest of the Arduino sketches.P.S. you may want to move this to the Arduino sectionSample of my ethernet responses FROM thingspeak below copied from coolterm--------------------------------------------------Connecting Arduino to network...Arduino connected to network using DHCPConnecting to ThingSpeak...HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8Transfer-Encoding: chunkedConnection: closeStatus: 200 OKX-Frame-Options: ALLOWALLAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, OPTIONS, DELETE, PATCHAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: origin, content-type, X-Requested-WithAccess-Control-Max-Age: 1800ETag: '470e7a4f017a5476afb7eeb3f8b96f9b'Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidateSet-Cookie: request_method=POST; path=/X-Request-Id: d90b6677-2f88-447c-8cee-8cba4a8c8081X-Runtime: 0.017518X-Powered-By: Phusion Passenger 4.0.57Date: Fri, 30 Oct 2015 02:52:40 GMTServer: nginx/1.9.3 + Phusion Passenger 4.0.5737570--------------------------------------------------", 'num_user_post': u' 19', 'author': u'BSB'}, {'date': u'October 30, 2015 - 4:36 am', 'content': u"Hi GuysThanks for reply.@rw950431:1.

If you can clear a string (or its buffer / array) after it has done its job that may help.For every file you open in your sketch be it string or otherwise for input or output you need to close it somewhere too.Make sure you have corresponding statements if you use that approach.As for connect time mine is currently set for every 3 seconds in the connection timer but it works out at 3 minutes in real time using a 2560 or almost 5 minutes using a leonardo.Some sensors have warmup times that can throw things off  as I found out with an MQ2 and a PIR.

So if you want to update properties on your device, then you should update your Channel.  If you want to update data that your device is measuring then you should update your Channel Feed.Changing the latitude/longitude of the Channel will update the map to display where the device is located, and is most useful for static devices.

I suggest a change to the ThingSpeak system to allow high rate 'last' update reading and writing, but average those values into the feed at 15 second periods.

I'm uploading data to ThingSpeak with one device and want to download/read that data with another device, an Arduino, which will then switch on a relay.The uploading data part is straightforward and there are loads of examples available online, however, the download of data seems to be a bit more cumbersome and less documented.I thought it would be possible to use React to trigger a ThingHTTP request in order to fetch each data point in the channel. And I still believe that it is possible, but I'm slightly bamboozled by the explanation on http://community.thingspeak.com/documentation/apps/thinghttp/Specifically:Parse StringThingHTTP sends back the full response that is generated by the request. If you are looking to extract a piece of data from the response, you can add a Parse String to the ThingHTTP Request. This feature allows you to do the parsing on the ThingSpeak side instead of wasting code space on the device / microcontroller side. The format is Parent_cell.child_cell etc. If you also know the full XPATH to the data, you can specify the XPATH as the Parse String.What does the Parent_cell.child_cell format refer to, how does it translate to normal people speak, and how can I use it to trigger a reaction on my arduino.Thanks.Moxi", 'num_user_post': u' 2', 'author': u'moxi'}]}, {'url': u'https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/thingspeak-api/api-pre-processing-data-before-saving/', 'posts': [{'date': u'April 18, 2013 - 3:00 am', 'content': u"Hi All,a feature that I found very interesting in 'competitors' like emoncms.org is the ability to preprocess data using some simple algorithms to be applied to received data before saving.

When an 'average' data series refreshes, the last data point will float as the average changes.  Every 15 seconds, the server will be queried.  If the average for that timeslice has changed, the chart will be updated to reflect the new value; otherwise, it won't change.  When sufficient time has gone by a new data point will be added to reflect the new timeslice and that point will begin to reflect the average.2.  Create Plugin Templates so multiple charts can be added for each data point.  A field could have two charts, one with the average and one with individual points.

This will show a chart for each of the 8 fields (the ones with data). Each chart has embed tag and you can\xa0customize\xa0it's meta data and options.if you want to customize a chart and show multiple lines of data, you can create a Plugin.So, a channel could be anything - the output of a sensor or a place to publish data from a process.

It would be trivial to be a location tracking mobile app with ThingSpeak.In your application, you would create a Channel, title it, add a description, and add tags. Then, assign and title a field for each sensor (1-8).The Devices tab is different than Channels. It's an app that lets you register a device, like an Arduino. It also allows you to store info about that device such as Public / Private IP addresses. If your devices needs a MAC address, you can generate a MAC address from our address pool.
