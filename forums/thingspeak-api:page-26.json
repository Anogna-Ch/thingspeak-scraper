I do not see new values being updated on my channel. I ran the testfor twice or thrice and found this value of 4hrs. I have also checked whether the communication between SIM900 and Arduino stops, but it is not so.I have wrote a simple program (within the above program) to send me a SMS if i give a miss call to the GSM module.So this works even after updating stalls.Does Thingspeak has any such limitation??

That was sort of my clue as it tended to stop even earlier with all the debug enabled.In my cases it simply stopped sending out any data but was still trying to connect and I combed my program looking for some simple error.It took me a while but I traced it down to delay statements and serial print statements causing a timing issue.Still not 100% sure just what it was as I did a blanket remark '//' on almost all the print statements apart from one that reads thingspeak responses 1 character at a timeI also reduced some of the delay statements or even remarked them out too where they were not actually required. The millis statements are not always as accurate as I would expect and to that aim I have some RTC's on order to add in to my setups.One of my channels ( 60110) has run pretty much perfect since then and any data anomalies I see are almost always ones I caused by testing with such as lighters on my temprature probes and lighter gas on my gas sensor etc.Just  brought another channel online  (62674) that is also pretty stable. as I learned a lot of lessons.

My project needs a timestamp (something needs to be turned on at a specific time) and I was wondering if there was a way to take the time from Thingspeak. The code I'm currently using reads some lines from Thingspeak and one of the lines is the date and time and I wanted to know if there was a way to take specific line out.So the format is Fri, 06 Nov 2015 HH:MM:SS GMTI need to have the program on from 5pm to 2am. Is there a way I can break the line up so I can just use the hour?Is there an easier way to do this??Thanks a ton!!", "num_user_post": " 9", "author": "abhishekjacob21"}, {"date": "November 7, 2015 - 12:45 am", "content": "What platform/language are you using?   If you split the line up into words based on spaces , get the 5th word, split that word on : then you have hours, minutes & seconds.  You may have to handle timezone conversions yourself, tricky if you have daylight savings.The exact means of doing this depends on which language you use.", "num_user_post": " 271", "author": "rw950431"}, {"date": "November 8, 2015 - 6:22 pm", "content": "I'm using the Arduino IDE platform", "num_user_post": " 9", "author": "abhishekjacob21"}, {"date": "November 8, 2015 - 9:39 pm", "content": "Perhaps this will help : https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/1013/how-do-i-split-an-incoming-string", "num_user_post": " 271", "author": "rw950431"}]}, {"url": "https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/thingspeak-api/updating-multiple-series-in-a-chart/", "posts": [{"date": "November 1, 2015 - 1:21 pm", "content": "I have a created a chart with multiple series and it works fine reading my different temperature sensors.
