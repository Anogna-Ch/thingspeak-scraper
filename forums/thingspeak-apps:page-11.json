I have read everything I can find and watched every video, so I apologize up front for not being able to figure this out.  I created a channel with one field called 'Color'.  I can post new colors to this channel from a web browser.  And I can read the colors with my Arduino application.  So far, so good.I then created a TweetControl for each color that should trigger a ThingHTTP App.  The settings for the TweetControl are: - Twitter Account: DRFLights - Trigger: Red (one for each color) - ThingHTTP Action: DRF HTTP Updater (which is my ThingHTTP Update App)Then I created a ThingHTTP App with the following settings (wish I could include a screen shot here...) - Name: DRF HTTP Updater - Key: ZL8GWNX18LVABXJ0 - URL: http://api.thingspeak.com/update - Username: (I left it Blank) - Password: (Also Blank) - Method: Post - Content Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded - HTTP Version: 1.1 - Host: api.thingspeak.com - Headers: (I Left it Blank) - Body: key=8EG143RZKMMF3P5C&field1=%%trigger%%&status=%%status%% - Parse String: (I Left it Blank)So - I send the following tweet @DRFLights #ThingSpeak Red from a Twitter account and it shows up OK in the DRFLights Twitter feed.  But the color doesn't show up as new data in my ThingSpeak channel.  I suspect that I don't have the ThingHTTP App not set up correctly.  But I'm clueless as to what I'm missing.

I made the change, but it still doesn't work.  Here's the crazy thing that I don't understand.  If I do a tweet to my Twitter account (DRFLights), it changes the CheerLights color, but not my color.  For example, if I tweet '@DRFLights #ThingSpeak Red' it will change the CheerLights color to Red immediately (but not show up in my feed).  My TweetControl App is specifying DRFLights as the Twitter account to watch, and DRF HTTP UPDATER to run my ThingHTTP App.It feels like the backend is vacuuming up all the Tweets that have one of the trigger keywords and routing them to CheerLights.  I hope that I'm doing something wrong, but it's not obvious to me right now.
