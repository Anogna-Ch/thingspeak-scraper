A channel feed can be updated by sending a GET or a POST (along with the channel API key) to https://api.thingspeak.com/update, which accepts parameters called 'lat' and 'long' to update it's location. Sending field data to this endpoint updates the graph rendered on the channel page but doesn't seem to change the map location rendered on the channel page.A channel can be updated by sending a PUT (along with the user API key) to https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/CHANNEL_ID.

So if you want to update properties on your device, then you should update your Channel.  If you want to update data that your device is measuring then you should update your Channel Feed.Changing the latitude/longitude of the Channel will update the map to display where the device is located, and is most useful for static devices.  If your device moves around, you probably want to update your Channel Feed, however we don't provide maps of this changing location data, although you could build one yourself using the Channel Feed.Hope this helps, please let me know if you have any more questions.lee", "num_user_post": " 457", "author": "lee"}]}, {"url": "https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/thingspeak-api/how-to-modify-data/", "posts": [{"date": "May 6, 2015 - 12:26 pm", "content": "I want to modify some old data so I can make my charts looking better.
