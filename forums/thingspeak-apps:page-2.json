It makes me wonder what would make sense to 'IoT' in my house and in my life.I have a problem though.I set up a channel (447365 - private) where I log temperatures of my boiler every 3 minutes with an ESP2866. I also set up a React that is supposed to tweet me (On Data Insertion) when a temperature raises above a certain level. I want it to only tweet once when the condition is met, therefore I set 'Run action only the first time the condition is met'.The twitter part works well, it tweets whenever the condition is met. The problem is that it tweets every time it's met, not only the first time. Even thoudh it's set to\u00a0'Run action only the first time the condition is met'.The data has no noise in it that would result the condition to go False and back to True.Thanks for your support!\u00a0Condition TypeString\u00a0Status\u00a0Numeric\u00a0Geo\u00a0No Data CheckTest FrequencyOn Data Insertion\u00a0Every 10 minutes\u00a0Every 30 minutes\u00a0Every 60 minutesConditionIf channelHeRo test (400669)\u00a0Kotel_Heves (447365)field1 (Zpatecka)\u00a02 (TUV)\u00a03 (Topeni_Radiator)\u00a04 (Okolni_teplota)\u00a05 (TUV_Ohrev)\u00a06 (Teplotni_Zisk_Kotle)\u00a07\u00a08is greater than\u00a0is greater than or equal to\u00a0is less than\u00a0is less than or equal to\u00a0is equal to\u00a0is not equal toActionThingHTTP\u00a0MATLAB Analysis\u00a0ThingTweetthen tweetusing Twitter accountHeRo_IoTOptionsRun action only the first time the condition is metRun action each time condition is met", "num_user_post": " 6", "author": "hroobert"}, {"date": "March 15, 2018 - 3:56 am", "content": "Sorry for the listing above.
