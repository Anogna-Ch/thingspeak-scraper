One assign the Arduino an IP address and port number. Two, create a port forward rule on your router. This port forward takes the public IP and port number and forwards it to one internal (private) IP and port number.So, Arduino has an IP of 192.68.0.123 and port number 8000. Your router has a public IP of 90.123.123.123 and port 8000. You\u00a0create\u00a0that port forward rule in the router so the public IP / port forwards to the private IP /port.

OAuth is a little too much processing for a basic microcontroller to handle so we have created a service that handles the OAuth to Twitter and allows you to send status updates via the ThingSpeak API.To try it out, sign in to https://thingspeak.com/login,\u00a0select Apps from the menu, and then click on ThingTweet.Under the ThingTweet App, select 'Link new Twitter account'. This will redirect you to Twitter to see if you want the app to have the ability to access your account. You can Allow or Deny the process. Once you have confirmed the right Twitter account, Twitter will send you back to ThingSpeak.We then generate a new API Key for you to use. If you send an HTTP POST with your key, then the message will be relayed to Twitter. All of the parameters\u00a0from the Twitter API (statuses/update) are possible.The URI is:http://api.thingspeak.com/apps/thingtweet/1/statuses/updateWe made our URL / URI to be\u00a0similar\u00a0to the actual Twitter API so it may be a drop in / switch out with not much headache. The only new addition is that you must send an API Key along with the parameters or in the X-THINGSPEAKAPIKAY header.api_key=(thingtweet_api_key)&status=I just posted this from a microcontroller!!!I will get the full\u00a0documentation\u00a0on our docs page, but I wanted to give you some early access.
