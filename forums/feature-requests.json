The same is true for sessions with a Keep Alive value of 0 (i.e. disabled).This is standard-conforming behavior, as the server is allowed to disconnect at any time, regardless of the Keep Alive. However, it is not really nice regarding low-power applications, as one of two things currently have to happen:A Keep Alive of less than 60 has to be chosen and the client device has to wake up and send a packet every 55 seconds (to be safe). OrFor every data packet with a period of greater than one minute, a new TCP connection and MQTT session have to be established.This is would normally not be necessary, as TCP connections are able to stay inactive yet connected ('established') for hours (days, really). In fact, TCP itself knows no idle timeouts at all but has the capability of sending keep-alive packets on its own.So, I would like to request considering to significantly raise the server-side timeout, or even better adhere to the Keep Alive requested by the client. If there are any concerns that led to implementing this extremely short timeout (e.g. fear of DOS attacks), I would love to hear about them.For the time being, I recommend to all users to set a Keep Alive value of 55 seconds or less in their clients. Quite a few implementations seem to use a default value of 60, which is nasty in this case, as it is just over the threshold and will unfortunately lead to a full reconnect every minute instead of just a ping.Anyway, thanks again for the MQTT implementation and maybe someone is able to sort this out.\xa0Best regards,Kilian", 'num_user_post': u' 3', 'author': u'kilian'}, {'date': u'December 7, 2016 - 4:15 pm', 'content': u"This being our initial release of the MQTT service, we had to make some trade-offs in our broker configuration. \xa0This is because we don't have an infinite number of TCP sockets on the broker. \xa0We want to give everyone a chance to try it out.

However, each Channel's Feed has 8 'Fields' and several additional meta data fields (ex: status, latitude, longitude, ect...). An update to a Channel's Feed may only include data written to any of these specified fields. It is possible to work around this limitation by doing some creative data mapping.For example, you may write to a Channel's Feed in the following wayfield1: shelf_numberfield2: red_valuefield3: green_valuefield4: blue_valueA MATLAB Analysis app may be used to then read the data from the Channel using the MATLAB function 'thingSpeakRead' and perform some action. A React app may be used to trigger the MATLAB Analysis app to execute the MATLAB code on data insertion to the Channel. The drawback of this approach, where a shelf is a different data point, is that data can only be written to a Channel every 15 seconds. You can use custom 'shelf' values which may set selves 1, 2, and 3 all to the specified RGB values or others which set shelves 1 and 2 or any combination.There is a slight workaround for a 'batch upload' using the MATLAB Analysis app. Please see lee's post for more information: http://community.thingspeak.com/forum/thingspeak-api/rfe-minimum-for-feed-api/#p2372", 'num_user_post': u' 4', 'author': u'hans'}]}]}, {'url': u'https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/feature-requests/page-3/', 'threads': [{'url': u'https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/feature-requests/math-in-channels/', 'posts': [{'date': u'May 15, 2013 - 1:18 pm', 'content': u"I recently discovered that my newly installed bee hive scale is temperature sensitive.

The automatic summing and averaging features on the channel feeds are great, but the limit of 8000 underlying data point limit is a real showstopper.

The user also har to do this processing on a regular basis (a scheduled job) in order to keep the aggregated channels up to date.It woud therefore be great if this could be done server side. Provide every field in the channel setup with a summing option (checkboxes for hourly and daily, and a sum/average/median/... dropbox). The server could then automatically do the summing/averaging/etc. to a 'hidden channel' at the end of every day/hour. Aggregated request could then get data from this 'hidden channel' instead of real time summing/averaging. This would probably reduce the server overall load.When this option is changed for a field the server could que a job resumming the field to the hidden channel.This would make this great server even greater, and extend the possibilities to do both coarse and detailed graphs on the same data series.

Say for example I produce a IoT project which I want to produce a small run of. For the device imagine i'm using an arduino with a cheap 16x2lcd shield with 6 buttons If I use thingspeak and talkback that means I need a way of getting a 16 character thingspeak key into the controller and a 16 character talkback key into the controller. I also need to store the channel number for thingspeak and the channel number for talkback.Thats a lot of keys to try and get an end user to enter via an lcd keypad.Ideally it would be nice to have an API which just lets me give each user say an 8 character unique key which when entered can respond with the users unique keys for thingspeak, talkback and both channel numbers.kind of a provisioning API.I've been messing about trying to find a way to do this with the current apps. The best I've got to is:Create a provisioning channel and hard code the key for this channel into the firmwareSend an update from the device to the provisioning channel. something likehttps://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&field1=PROVISION_SERIAL_NO,3374-3H8Ua react then picks up the PROVISION_SERIAL_NO,3374-3H8Uand triggers a similarly names Thing HTTP.This then places a talkback command with the new keys. something likehttps://api.thingspeak.com/talkbacks/539/commands?api_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&command_string=PROVISION_FOR_SERIAL_NO,3374-3H8U,123456,YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,567,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZSo the pseudocode for the provisioning on the arduino would beInform user 'Registering with server' Please waitRequest provisiondelay(5000);Request command responsebyte attempts=1;while (requested serial key != recieved serial key){Request provisiondelay 5000Re Request command responseattempts++if(attempts==6){Inform the user 'There is a problem. Please check your Serial number'delay(5000);break;}}if Serial key matches the serial key that was requested{Inform the user 'Controller registered OK'Delay(5000)Write data to eepromsoft reset without delay}Of course the down side of this approach means I need to manually create a react for each unique user and also a thinghttp for each user.Additionally, if anyone is able to get hold of the provisioning channel key, they can then listen for a provision request on the channel and grab the resultant talkback.

(Measured up to the second)- When you can set that option at the field level, you have also made it possible to correct only one field.

All other temperatures are OK. For this a user would need to specify a higher limit and a lower limit so the system can signal accordingly.Currently this can only be achieved by setting 2 separate reacts for the same variable, one checking if the value is below a lower limit and one checking if its above a higher limit.This setup could then also be used (I hope) to do the opposite, so get a message when the temperature is OK and inside the band.

Unfortunately the thesis should contains implementation part too and I have to show some statistical reports and analyse data to prove results. They won't accept theoretical research, but it's acceptable if I use simulators in my thesis and I have to use some published papers as my references too. In another word it shouldn't be a completely innovate idea that nobody worked before. These are our faculty rules! I'm not a software developer and I just worked with C++ but I'll be able to learn simple programming if needed. I have about 5 months to complete my thesis and I would be appreciated if someone helps me find my master thesis topic.
