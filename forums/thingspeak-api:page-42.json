Inside a channel you can have 8 fields that store alphanumeric data, 3 location fields (lat/long/elevation), and one status field (this is like a status update).On the channel page, there is a link that says, 'View Charts'. This will show a chart for each of the 8 fields (the ones with data). Each chart has embed tag and you can\u00a0customize\u00a0it's meta data and options.if you want to customize a chart and show multiple lines of data, you can create a Plugin.So, a channel could be anything - the output of a sensor or a place to publish data from a process. With the addition of geolocation fields and status, you can also give the data more context. It would be trivial to be a location tracking mobile app with ThingSpeak.In your application, you would create a Channel, title it, add a description, and add tags. Then, assign and title a field for each sensor (1-8).The Devices tab is different than Channels. It's an app that lets you register a device, like an Arduino. It also allows you to store info about that device such as Public / Private IP addresses. If your devices needs a MAC address, you can generate a MAC address from our address pool.
