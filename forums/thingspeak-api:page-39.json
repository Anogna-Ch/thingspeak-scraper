I've got a couple ideas and wanted to mention them here to get some feedback on what our users think.1.  When an 'average' data series refreshes, the last data point will float as the average changes.  Every 15 seconds, the server will be queried.  If the average for that timeslice has changed, the chart will be updated to reflect the new value; otherwise, it won't change.  When sufficient time has gone by a new data point will be added to reflect the new timeslice and that point will begin to reflect the average.2.  Create Plugin Templates so multiple charts can be added for each data point.  A field could have two charts, one with the average and one with individual points.  This way dynamic data would be displayed every time your hardware sends an update, but the average chart would update more slowly to show accumulated data only.", "num_user_post": " 9", "author": "akinsgre"}, {"date": "February 20, 2013 - 8:24 am", "content": "hi,sound great!Number 1. is how the charts worked before?
