There are several ways you can achieve this.  You can write data (https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/writedata.html) and use a field value to indicate the light status.  Then the value would show in your ThingSpeakPlot on your channel view.  You can even add a gage widget that will visually show the value.https://www.mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/channel_display_widgets.htmlAnother option would be to use a MATLAB visualization to show a color on the channel based on the light status that you write to a filed.  Here is an example of that kind of indicator with traffic:https://thingspeak.com/channels/38629You could write an indication to the status field and then use your channel settings to show the status on your channel view.Here is the format for using the REST API to update the status.https://api.thingspeak.com/update.json?api_key=&status=lightOn!Can you tell us more about the project?
