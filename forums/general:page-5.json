For example, I can control ZigBee Xbee's from ThingHttp using a script in the body and can copy and paste and just change radio and gateway IDs in the script for multiple Xbee's / gateways.I now also use MATLAB visualizations that are now included with TS since MathWorks took over. These are great for filling in missing data, moving to new channels and removing spurious data. Wind Velocity compass plot,Most other IoT platforms either have complex setups and then charge for additional functionality and do not have the easy to use Apps that are already incorporated into TS.Unlike mnt's post above, I have found no change or break in functionality and wonder what he is referring to????Yes, the new login makes you use an e-mail address but that was all that changed for me.If transmitting 85 fields every 15 minutes or 170 fields every 30 mins is not enough for personal use, then you may be doing it wrong!.. using an API to check a channel status does not count towards the limits, as I understand it... just the API writing to a channel field.I have not had time to utilize the trial MATLAB toolboxes and great things like the 'neural network learning' but see these as a great add on even if they cost.A lot of other IoT sites charge for basic services and then have different levels of service and apps which are charged for in addition.I believe that ThingSpeak is a GREAT tool and service even if the API levels have been reduced for a personal account...It still gives you the ability to perform multiple tasks and data manipulation and to test out various sensors and systems - for free.If you are prototyping a system to use commercially and require control, easy to use integrated Apps and Plugins then ThingSpeak with the new MathWorks functions is a great platform to use.When you need to launch your products/systems commercially, you have everything ready and just need to upgrade to a paid account. The Paid account gives the added benefits of over 10 times the number of write requests and the ability to write every second rather than 15 seconds like the free account.

My company has been using Thingspeak for about a year now to manage data collection for devices installed across the continental US.

It is reasonable to charge for the maintenance and development of the platform.Mnt, what functionality have you seen reduced, removed, or broken? If anything, the transition to a paid service has been less complicated than I expected. The purchasing of the appropriate number of licenses is simple and has worked well because it is built into the MathWorks' License Center.ThingSpeak has been and I expect will continue to be a great platform for developing data collection hardware systems and it's integration with MATLAB make it solid choice for then analyzing that collected data.It seems to me that Hans has addressed any legitimate concerns.
