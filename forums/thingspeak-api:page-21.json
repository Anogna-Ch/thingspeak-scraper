I have a lot of things to try to explain / ask, so we can get to the bottom of the issue. We might need a few exchanges in order to get to the heart of the issue.1) Looking into your channel data, I see that Field 8 gets a lot of 'nulls' - and only every once in awhile I see actual values like '3.67'.You can see it with this API call: https://thingspeak.com/channels/71167/fields/8.json?days=5&timezone=America/New_YorkAre you updating your channel with separate requests? For example: /update?field1=100 and then another request like /update?field2=200 ? If you do the updates to a channel with separate requests, then the other fields get a null value. You should send requests that look like /update?field1=100&field2=200 (send multiple fields in one request). You might be sending all of the data at once, so you might want to look at what is causing the nulls in your channel.2) Nulls\u00a0skew average calculations. You are getting very low averages since you are averaging null, null, null, 3.67, null, etc. The average is going to be really low.3) A median might be better suited for your data. Try this:https://thingspeak.com/channels/71167/charts/8?days=100&median=daily4) I would also like to suggest MATLAB Analysis - if you are not able to send cleaned up data to ThingSpeak, then you can use MATLAB Analysis to read in the raw data, process it, then write the processed data to a new channel. Then, you do not have to use the average / median filters that the API provides. average / median only solves some basic clean up use cases. MATLAB ANalysis is intended to be complete custom clean up and processing of IoT data.Let us know if this helps.Hans", "num_user_post": " 402", "author": "Hans"}, {"date": "June 24, 2016 - 5:39 am", "content": ">1) Looking into your channel data, I see that Field 8 gets a lot of 'nulls' - >and only every once in awhile I see actual values like '3.67'.yes sir correct, however, I am not the one who make the nulls \ud83d\ude42>Are you updating your channel with separate requests?YES, correct again \ud83d\ude42 so I am the one who make the null, simply due to another problem, I use several wireless sensors, they send data at different rates, but to the SAME database, just different curve, and to make it even worse, I send my battery voltages at a very low rate, simply due to the 8000 point limit, this way I tried to make the time span wider for voltage curves.>2) Nulls\u00a0skew average calculations.

What's odd is that I can download the data and see that it is\u00a0actually making it into\u00a0the cloud, but it's just not showing up on the graph (?). This is a relatively recent development, and I have not changed anything in my graph settings to merit this . Here is an example of the data downloaded from ThingSpeak that is not shown on the graph for June 6:created_atentry_idfield1field2field3\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 13:32:26 UTC599240680013:37:07graph suggest data is dropped past this point2016-06-06 13:44:36 UTC5993406800\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 13:56:47 UTC5994407300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 14:08:58 UTC5995407900\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 14:21:08 UTC5996409000\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 14:33:18 UTC5997409500\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 14:45:28 UTC5998410600\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 14:57:39 UTC5999413400\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 15:09:49 UTC6000417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 15:21:59 UTC6001417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 15:34:10 UTC6002417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 15:46:20 UTC6003417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 15:58:31 UTC6004417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 16:10:41 UTC6005417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 16:22:51 UTC6006417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 16:35:01 UTC6007417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 16:47:12 UTC6008417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 16:59:22 UTC6009417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 17:11:32 UTC6010417300\u00a0\u00a02016-06-06 17:23:42 UTC601141730017:11:37graph suggests data is picked up after this pointAny ideas or suggestions are greatly appreciated.", "num_user_post": " 2", "author": "biod101"}, {"date": "June 9, 2016 - 11:21 pm", "content": "Am noticing something similar but not sure if its the same exactlyAnd I think its taken me about 2 weeks to actually catch it in the act.AM using an MKR1000 and I thought it was the board that was pooched but I changed my debug output method and noticed it has sent some data on two occasions but that TS was reporting last connected\u00a0(x) amount of time which was behind the sent data connection by an hour or so.Also seeing a very sluggish site too often not refreshing properly and wonder if that is linked somehow ?", "num_user_post": " 19", "author": "BSB"}, {"date": "June 14, 2016 - 11:11 pm", "content": "Thanks for the reply.
