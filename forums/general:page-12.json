Many platform players will jump into this space and make it unclear for consumers. It's also natural to try and find a business model.The best place to be is where you have an active development community and a low-cost infrastructure to support them. ThingSpeak has both, thankfully.A big step is coming for ThingSpeak and we need to tap into not only connected device developers but application developers that will make the platform their own.I would ask you to provide feedback on what we can do to help you with your projects. The more input / commits that come from the community, the more this platform will exist and compete. IoT is about to get real interesting IMHO.Thanks for the convo starter,HansPS.

I've looked through the documentation, but found no examples on the use of min... anyone have an example of this?  Or what the value syntax should be?

Is there a way to programmatically (api) add channels and device?Instead of using the dashboard so I can have my own dashboard and the channels will be automatically  created according to the desired logic.2. Does the open source API contains the ThingSpeak apps as well? And more specifically does it includes the ThingHTTP and React?3. If I start using thing speak normally and then would like to migrate to open source API and have my own server. Is there a way to get all my data?Thanks a lot!Gil", "num_user_post": " 1", "author": "gil"}]}, {"url": "https://community.thingspeak.com/forum/general/testing-upgraded-forum-software/", "posts": [{"date": "February 10, 2013 - 8:56 am", "content": "Things may look different on the forum.
