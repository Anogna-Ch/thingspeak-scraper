I'm trying to use a GPRS shield (Arduino) to upload data to Thingspeak through a SMS gateway on an Android phone.  The SMS gateway will encode the characters within the http string and Thingspeak will not accept the update.  This is how it works....The SMS gateway takes the body of the SMS message and appends it onto this string - http://api.thingspeak.com/update?key=MYKEYHERE&field1=SMSBODYGOESHERE.  But when it actually sends the message, it sends the '=' sign as '%3d'.  It also encodes the '&' and '?'.  Is there a way to get around this on the Thingspeak side?  UPDATE:  I should add, that I do get a positive response from the server indicating the data was accepted (a number indicating the row) but when I check, the cell is blank.

My WiFly RN-131C is on firmware 4.41 if that matters, I updated my WiFly from as-shipped firmware 2.32 as follows:$$$set wlan ssid MySSID             ## configure your wifi access point nameset wlan pass MyPASSWORD       ## configure your wifi passwordset wlan join 1   ## automatically connect to wifi on bootupreboot$$$set ftp user rovingset ftp password Pass123set ftp directory publicset ftp filename wifly3-441.imgset ftp mode 1set ftp address 198.175.253.161saveftp updatefactory RESETrebootFirst setup your wifly via serial port as follows ('$$$' by itself, typed quickly, is the escape to command mode).  Sorry for formatting mess, this forum sorely lacks a 'code' tag. Do not type in the comments starting with the '#' of course.$$$set wlan ssid MySSID             # configure your wifi access point nameset wlan pass MyPASSWORD       # configure your wifi passwordset ip tcp-mode 0x0                   # default TCP-Mode flagsset ip flags 0x6                      # default TCP/IP setup flagsset ip protocol 2      # TCP server and client (only)set sys autoconn 1                    # auto-connect to remote host on powerupset ip host 184.106.153.149           # IP address of ThingSpeak serverset ip remote 80                      # IP port number of remote TCP hostset comm remote POST      # string sent to remote TCP host when port openssave              # store config setup in flashreboot                            # restart and auto-join wifi, auto-open TCP to hostNow you can manually enter the data to ThingSpeak through the WiFly serial terminal but every line must end with 2-character pair CR LF which may not happen just with the 'enter' key, I had to type control-M control-J after each line. Note initial 'POST' missing as I configured that to be the string sent immediately upon opening the TCP connection to port 80, above.  So first character typed is a space, then /update etc.CR = ^M = 0x0d = r = Carriage returnLF = ^J = 0x0a = n = Line feed /update HTTP/1.1Host: api.thingspeak.comConnection: closeX-THINGSPEAKAPIKEY: MySecretKeyContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedContent-Length: 29field1=354&status=Just_a_test", "num_user_post": " 7", "author": "jbeale"}, {"date": "June 26, 2014 - 9:40 am", "content": "Hi Jbeale, could you share the code you used to connect wifly to ThingSpeak and arduino.Cheers", "num_user_post": " 19", "author": "rodri"}, {"date": "June 26, 2014 - 10:30 am", "content": "Hi Rodri,There is some example code here that you might find useful: https://github.com/thisandagain/arduino-wifly-thingspeak .lee", "num_user_post": " 457", "author": "lee"}, {"date": "September 12, 2014 - 12:21 am", "content": "Yeah I'm looking for an example I can get working.
