A gas meter with an impulse external module is installed there. I'm going to connect this external module with Arduino and via Internet upload information to ThingsSpeak.The problem is in the following: the external module provides me only an impulse. And I can upload a ping (1) to ThingsSpeak via Internet. This is useful in terms that I know when the meter counts another 0,01 cub.m. of gas. But I also would like to see not only pings at the time scale but also the current amount of pings. That means that every new ping should increase the total amount of pings at ThingsSpeak.I briefly checked the samples and functions description but couldn't find a way how to increase the total amount of pings at ThingsSpeak. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\xa0So the only way how to solve this is to get the last ping number from ThingsSpeak and with the every new ping increase it at Arduino side and send updated value to ThingsSpeak.

And it is is similar to just pre read the latest value from the main channel and upload an incremented value to the same channel.Option 1: Download the latest value from ThingSpeak at Arduino start-up and store it in the memory. Pros: we need to download it only once. Cons: if something wrong at Arduino side the results may be wrong (but likelikilyhood is very very low).Option 2: Download the latest value just before update the channel. Increment and update another channel. Pros: we can adjust the latest value from outside (for example justify meter's count) and we don't need to reboot Arduino. Cons: the server responce can be delayed and that leads to a potentiall miss of a click from the meter (the system is busy with waiting responce from the server).Option 3: Download the latest value from one channel then update both of them.

And it works well in version 1.1.1 of the library.People presence can be implemented much easier than PIR. Everyone has a mobile phone. And if you have Wi-Fi at the site then you can track presence of people at the site by their mobile phones connected to your wi-fi. Of cource the mobile phone shouldn't switch off wi-fi module when the screen is off. I already implemented this at bash.PS. The link you mentioned works only for public channels.
