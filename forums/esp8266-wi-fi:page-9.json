It is based on the ESP8266 microcontroller on a custom PCB with integrated USB transceiver and voltage regulator. All ESP8266 GPIO's are routed to two stackable header connectors that can easily be mounted in a breadboard.To match this base board I have also created a number of different add on modules that can be snapped together in to a stack of boards to form the desired functionality.I'm currently Kickstarting this project and if you're interested in learning more about the project please go ahead and visit: http://kck.st/1IVY0C6.
