With MATLAB from MathWorks, you have access to powerful data processing and analysis functions for IoT data. To extend the functionality, we offer toolboxes such as the\xa0Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox\u2122\xa0and\xa0Signal Processing Toolbox\u2122. These toolboxes need a license from MathWorks. If you have access to these toolboxes linked to a MathWorks Account, you have access to many of the toolboxes on ThingSpeak. All you have to do is to log in to ThingSpeak using your MathWorks Account credentials.When you are logged into ThingSpeak using your MathWorks\xa0Account, you can use functions from the following toolboxes if you are licensed to use them:Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox\u2122Curve Fitting Toolbox\u2122Control System Toolbox\u2122Signal Processing Toolbox\u2122Mapping Toolbox\u2122System Identification Toolbox\u2122Neural Network Toolbox\u2122DSP System Toolbox\u2122Datafeed Toolbox\u2122Financial Toolbox\u2122We have created many examples showing you how to use MATLAB Toolboxes using ThingSpeak channel data. We have an example using the\xa0Signal Processing Toolbox to\xa0Visualize and Remove Outliers in Your Data\xa0which a common task when you are working with IoT data from sensors. If you want to forecast environmental data by using a feedforward neural network, we have an example using the Neural Network Toolbox operating on weather station data collected by ThingSpeak. In all of our examples, you are able to use the code right on ThingSpeak and allow it to run on a schedule using TimeControl or be triggered to run using React.
