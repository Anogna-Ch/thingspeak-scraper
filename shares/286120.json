Possibly, rain blew into the unit through the vents in the solar shield. The unit was clean and started to report data as soon as external power was applied so the D1 Mini and the shields are still good. I replaced the sensor shield because the humidity reading always seemed high. Also, installed a new LiPo cell."},{"author": "tesla1752", "creation_time": "about 2 months ago", "text": "2018-08-06 - Installed Franklin version. Includes alarms in status reports.
