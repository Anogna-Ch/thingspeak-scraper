I would like to achieve as you have it.I would like to know if you could help me with any questions I have. For example, I can not see decimals in thingpeak, although on the Arduino IDE serial monitor if they appear to me, do I have to configure something in thingspeak?Thank you very much,Alejandroalejayo@gmail.com"},{"author": "anton5k", "creation_time": "about 1 year ago", "text": "Hi Alejandro.Thanks for expressing interest in my project.As for your question about the precision of data sent to ThingSpeak I can answer that no extra setup is needed. Make sure you convert data properly in your sketch.And based on your channels feed I see you've alreade sorted this out.Best regards,Anton"}], "maps": "", "matlabs": "", "language": "en"}
